# Introduction

This project aims to provide a script able to synchronize two folders, a source and a replica. The content has to be identical after each synchronization and the sync is based on the source folder. 

More details on the requirements:

- Synchronization is one way, from a source to a replica. After synchronization the content of the two folders has to match

- Synchronization should be performed periodically

- File creation/copying/removal operations should be logged to a file and to the console output

- Folder paths, synchronization intervals and log file path should be provided using the command line arguments;
- No usage of third-party libraries that implement folder synchronization
- It is allowed (and recommended) to use external libraries implementing other well-known algorithms 

# Libraries
In this project the following libraries have been used:

- [logging](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html)

- [sys](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html?highlight=sys#module-sys) : 

- [filecmp](https://docs.python.org/3/library/filecmp.html?highlight=filecmp#module-filecmp)

- [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html?highlight=os#module-os)

- [shutil](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html?highlight=shutil)

- [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html?highlight=argpars)

- [time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html?highlight=time#module-time)

# How to use
When the project is available locally, open the terminal on the path of the project folder. 

The script can be executed with the following command (example):

``` 
main.py -s "<sourcePath>" -r "<replicaPath>" -l "<logPath>" -i <interval>

 ```

Make sure the all the folders are created beforehand. If the path is not existing or invalid, the script will stop before the synchronization and a message will be printed in the terminal. Also make sure Python is installed on the computer.

The path arguments are required, but not the interval. It default value is 5 (seconds).

The command arguments are as follows:

```
  -h, --help       Show help message and exit

  -s, --source:    Path of source folder

  -r, --replica:   Path of replica folder

  -i, --interval:  Interval between synchronization (seconds)

  -l, --log:       Path of log folder
```

 The minimum interval to set between the synchronization is 5 seconds. 

 # Use cases

 The script supports the different scenarios:

 1. A file is modified in the source folder => The file will be updated in the replica folder.
 
 1. A file is modified in the replica folder => The file will be updated to match the source file.

 1. A file or directory is removed from the source folder => The file or directory will be removed from the replica folder.

 1.  A file or directory is removed from the replica folder => The file or directory will be created in the replica folder (copy) to match the source folder

 1. A file or directory is added in the source folder => The file or directory will be created in the replica folder (copy) to match the source folder

 1. A file or directory is added in the replica folder => The file or directory will be removed if itâ€™s not matching the source folder

 # Operations
## Update
The update operation is done only on files. 

Source and replica folders are provided to the function "getMismatchFiles" and it will return a list of files that's not matching. 

The function uses the library "filecmp" to compare the two folders and get the common files (matching names). Then, it will compare each files from this list and return the list of mismatch files. 

The list returned is then used in the function "updateFile", which will loop on each file, to remove it in the replica and copy it from the source folder.

### Name update
If a file or directory is renamed, it is considered as another instance. Instead of updating the name, the file or directory will be removed (delete operation) from replica folders and then copied (create operation) from the source folder into the replica folder. So no update operation is used in case of renaming a file or directory.

## Delete
The delete operation uses the function "getToDelete" to receive a list of file or directory to remove. This operation is done only on the replica folder.

This list is generating by comparing the two folders, the "right_only" attribute allow to get the files or directories only available in the replica folder. In other words, there is no match for them in the source folder and should not be there. 

The operation is meant for the files and directories, a different command is needed for removing directories as more privilege is required. It is the reason of the test with "if" "isFile" or "isDir".

## Create
Create operation is meant for files and directories. When a file or directory is present in the source folder, but not in the replica. 

The list is provided by the function "getToCreate", which will compare two folders with the attribute "left_only". It represents the files or directories only available in the source folder.

The function "create" will loop on the list to copy each file or directory in the replica folder.

When a directory is copied, all of its content will be copied in the replica folder. 

# Recursive function "synchroniseFolder"
The function synchronization is initially executed to compare the source and replica folder. Then, it will arrange the content to be the same. However, we also need to check the subdirectories to ensure that all the files inside are matching. 

At the end of the function "synchroniseFolder", it will get a list of all subdirectories from the source folder. If none is present, the script stops.

On the other hand, if there are subdirectories, the function will be called again in order to compare the content of the subdirectories. Then after arranging the subdirectories, the same will happen, if there are again subdirectories the function will call itself again with the new folders to check. It will stop after there is not more subdirectories to check.

# Logging
The logger is generated in "logger.py" and is passed into the function "synchroniseFolder" in order to be used during the operations. 

The logger is able to log into a file, which its path has to be mentioned in the arguments and also in the console output. 

In order to do so, two handlers have to be configured to redirect the log into the file and the console output:
-  >FileHandler(path +"\log.txt")

- >StreamHandler(sys.stdout)

The path of the log folder has to be existing  otherwise the script will print a message and stop.

# Command line arguments
The command line arguments are handled with the library "argparse". All paths are required and will be tested with "os.path.isDir" to check if it is existing or valid path. If that's not the case, the script will print a message and stop.

The interval argument is not required, but has a default value of 5. The value is in seconds and is tested to be higher than 5, otherwise the script will print a message and stop. 

The interval default value has been set to 5 seconds.

# Synchronization execution
In the current state of the project, the script will execute 10 synchronizations with the interval specified in the arguments. After that the program will stop.

The reason is to have an end to the script, otherwise it will run until it is manually interrupted. 

In case of the script is needed to run forever, the loop while can be modified with a true condition:

> while True:

And it can be manually interrupted with CTRL+C, but will end up with an error in the terminal.

# Preview
## Full cycle
The script is executed with an interval of 6 seconds between synchronization and will loop for 10 times before ending.

The synchronization starts right away to have the content of the two folders matching. Then, manipulations can be done on the source or replica folder and each operation is logged in the console output as well as the log file. 

## Log file
When the script is executed, if the log file is not existing already, it will be created. If it already exists, the operation will be logged after the existing ones in the file.
